# Socket BWT Service

## Description

In this directory you can find the simplest Client - Server application for the Burrows Wheeler Transform project. In this solution, you just have to start the server and then run the client and connect to the server. (You may have to change the HOST settings in the client and server scripts if you want to test in a multi-machine environment). 
The server needs <a href='../Components/'>Components</a> to run.
